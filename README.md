# git-practice

Practicing my `git` commands for branching and merging so I donâ€™t break anything important.

## Creating the Repo

1. Repo was initialized with `git init`
2. Creating `README.md`
3. Added `README.md` to repo

        git add README.md

4. Repo created on [GitHub](https://github.com) through the web interface
5. Remote origin added with

        git remote add origin https://github.com/dustykeyboard/git-practice.git

6. Publish to GitHub repo

        git push -u origin master

## Making Changes

1. Start from `master` branch

        git checkout master && git pull

2. Create *feature* branch

        git checkout -b feature/readme-text

3. Make changes
4. Push changes to feature branch on GitHub

        git push origin feature/readme-text
